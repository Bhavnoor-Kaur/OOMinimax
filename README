Notes and Assumptions:

- submit.git.log.txt: This file contains the git commits of the changes made.
- debugger.png: Contains a screenshot of the debugger conatains the stack frames
                in the call stack.
- oominimax.py: This file contains the oo - version of the minimax.py provided
                It contains the following classes and the functions:

                class State: This class contains the methods - render, wins, evaluate,
                             game_over, empty_cells, get_depth, valid_move and set_move.
                             This class sets the board for the play and checks for valid moves
                             and sets the move based on the co-ordinated passed into them. This
                             function also keeps track of the empty cells on the board to check
                             for valid moves and evaluates if the game is over or not.
                
                class Play: This class contains the methods - ai_turn and human_turn which
                            plays the computer turn and the human turn by setting the move
                            for a valid move in an empty cell on the board. The ai_turn uses
                            the function minimax to decide the best move.

                minimax: This is an AI function which choses the best ove for the computer turn
                         It returns the best move which in turn is taken by the ai turn to play
                         the game
                
                main: Main function calls all the methods from different classes and functions to
                      run the game, it also takes cares of the possible errors and prints out error
                      statement to indicate that to the user.
